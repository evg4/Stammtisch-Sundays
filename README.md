## Project Title
Stammtisch Sundays
## Description
I made this webpage using HTML and CSS on 25.05.23 as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path. The purpose was to practise using @media rulesets to ensure responsive design. I adjusted the font size and positioning of certain elements as the size decreases.
